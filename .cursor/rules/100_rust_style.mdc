 Rust Code Style Guidelines:

1. Code Organization:
   - Group imports by std, external, crate
   - Keep functions focused and small
   - Use type aliases for complex types
   - Prefer composition over inheritance

2. Naming Conventions:
   - Use snake_case for functions/variables
   - Use PascalCase for types/traits
   - Use SCREAMING_SNAKE for constants
   - Prefix unsafe functions with unsafe_

3. Error Handling:
   - Use custom error types with thiserror
   - Provide helpful error messages
   - Avoid unwrap/expect in production
   - Use anyhow for application code

4. Documentation:
   - Document all public items
   - Include examples in doc tests
   - Link to related items
   - Explain panics and safety

5. Testing:
   - Write unit tests for all modules
   - Use test fixtures appropriately
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test error conditions
